# What is Flesh Puppet?

Flesh Puppet is a Discord bot that is linked to a frontend lookalike of the actual Discord, allowing people who can't join a group's Discord server to use the Flesh Puppet instead. Since the Flesh Puppet can only access one server, it is much safer for administrators/parents/guardians who want to restrict where their subordinate can go on the internet.
